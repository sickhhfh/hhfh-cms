## FORMAT

The following format is always followed for all entries in movie categories. Movies with *DVDRip* quality are to
be added under sdmovie category. The allowed exceptions is for non-English movies or movies released before 1960s.

>     [<Quality>] [<Language>] [<Audio>] [<Genre>] <Name> (<Year>) [<link>] [<size>] <magnet>

### Examples

    [BluRay m720p] [AUS] [Action] [Crime] [Drama] Mystery Road (2013) [ http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2236054/ ] [797 MiB]
    [BluRay 720p] [Drama] [Fantasy] Crimson Winter (2013) [ http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2014198/ ] [5.00 GiB]

`<Language>` and `<Audio>` tags can be skipped for **ENG** language and audio. All other cases need to be
mentioned. English movies with dual-audio MUST have the `<Audio>` tag.


## NOTES

01. AT MOST 3 seperate entries for the same movie are allowed in this category.
        - WEB-DL 720p or (WEBHD 720p & WEBHD 1080p) (for bollywood movie). WEB-DL 1080p is not allowed
        - BluRay (720p & 1080p)
        - mini-BluRay (m720p & m1080p)
02. Give spaces after each parameter or info or tag. The genres should each be tagged separately like "[Action] [Thriller]" and NOT "[Action/Thriller]".
03. IMDb links are mandatory. Do NOT use url shortners for IMDb links. If no IMDb link can be found, search for wikipedia page, failing which you can add it without link.
04. Name your file/directory with same name as movie, such as: "The Avengers (2012).m2ts"
05. ALWAYS use parenthesis for year.
06. Do NOT add m720ps of WEB-DL versions. The BluRays are released soon, add an m720p version of that instead. Add WEB-DL m720p only if no other version is available.
07. Do NOT add DVDRips if HD versions (WEB-DLs or Blurays) are already added.
08. For older movies prefer BluRay m720ps. Other versions may be accepted if m720p is not available.
09. For movies other than ENG, HIN, TEL add only DVDRips & BluRays with their ENG-Subs present in your share.
